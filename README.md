# InstagramInfluencerFakeFollowerProportion Project
Project dedicated to determine the "fake" follower proportion of any given Instagram influencer.

This program is primarily an exercise, not a serious project. As such, the different parts of this README will correspond to chronological steps, and a method used in a specific step may be found to have been less than optimal in a later step.
All this will be reported in the "chronological step" where it was discovered

## The idea:

Social network influencers tend to have "fake" followers, accounts created solely to add to follower counts without engaging with said influencers.
Some influencers pay directly for such followers to a specialized service, while others do not and still end up with them (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVfHeWTKjag).
In either case, the result is the same: a significant number of the influencer's followers do not consume said influencer's content, making them less effective brand advocates.

I aim to create a classification tool able to give the proportion of these "fake" followers, for any given Instagram influencer, by replicating and adapting the process made by journalists of the swiss media group SRF (https://srfdata.github.io/2017-10-instagram-influencers/).
I will be using different tools than them, mainly because I will develop my program in Python, while they used the R programming language.

## The original plan:

1. Scrape and process data from public and private Instagram accounts.
2. Extract data from 500 accounts and manually label them real or fake.
   * The number "500" was arbitrarily chosen, and might not be enough to provide good results. But manual labeling being time-consuming, the number couldn't be too high.
3. Train a classification ML algorithm to detect fake accounts. Tweak hyperparameters for optimal results.
4. Repeat for multiple other classification algorithms, and keep the best performing.
5. Determine the fake follower proportion of a few Instagram influencers. Compare the obtained values with data from articles found online (such as this one: https://www.meltwater.com/uk/blog/influencer-fraud/).
6. If needed, wrap all this in one easy-to-use program.

## The collection of Instagram data

This part is divided into multiple classes:

### Scraping the metadata of a given Instagram account, public or private

This is done using the InstagramDataScraper class of the scraper module.

Given an instagram user's ID, the getInfo method returns an array of information on said user.
The array contains:
* The Instagram user's ID (again) - String
* The number of followers the user has - Integer, approximation if the number is big (>10000)
* The number of other users the user's following - Integer, approximation if the number is big
* The total number of posts from the user* The total number of posts from the user - Integer, approximation if the number is big
* If the user's account is private - Boolean
* If the user's ID contains a number - Boolean
* If the user's account countains a number specifically at the end of the string  - Boolean
* The user's ID's letter ratio (number of alphabetical symbols / total number of symbols in the string) - Floating point number
* The user's following-to-follower ratio - Floating point number, may be infinite
* The user's following-to-number of posts ratio - Floating point number, may be infinite
* The user's follower-to-number of posts ratio - Floating point number, may be infinite

The data is obtained by parsing the Instagram source code. If the source code format changes significantly compared to the current format at the time of writing, this class may not function anymore.

### Collecting and processing follower data

To extract a list of Instagram followers for a given public account, I used the Google Chrome extension "Helper Tools for Instagram" (HTfI, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/helper-tools-for-instagra/hcdbfckhdcpepllecbkaaojfgipnpbpb).

This extension needs an Instagram account to function, and is only usable through the browser, limiting automation. It can, however, provide all the information that is scraped through the InstagramDaraScraper class, rendering it mostly useless.

I have decided to not extract too much data with the HTfI extension, and to keep using the InstagramDataScraper class for most of the work. If this project is to be integrated into a real product, I would advise to find an alternative to both these tools usable through Python, or another programming language.

The extracted data can be found in the extracted_data folder, and through execution of the preprocess_followers.py script, new .csv files will appear in the processed_data folder.

Notice that some of the processed files have few or no corresponding Instagram accounts. That is because the data scraper didn't work on them. One interpretation would be that in the few minutes between collecting the data and processing it, some of these these accounts were deleted.
However, I have tried searching manually for some of these users, and have found that they were not deleted. The "deleted accounts" hypothesis seemed to not hold up for the most part.

This gives further weight to the point that my collecting / preprocessing method needs improving, as we probably lost a lot of good examples of fake accounts.

After having collected the data, I labeled it manually and exported it to the labeled_data.csv file, using the label_examples.py script.
I automatically labeled the one deleted account I encountered as fake.

Note that this process was highly subjective, and by definition biased. More on that later.

Finally, I collected data on about 10000 followers of the Ritz-Carlton. I initially encountered the same problem as before, with the scraper generating errors for a lot of accounts at a time.
I found out that by imposing a 2-minute timeout after each scraper error, I could greatly limit further errors.

### Implementing the Random Forest algorithm

The Random Forest algorithm is implemented in the random_forest.py script, which takes into account the number of trees to implement.
Testing has shown that it is the single most important hyperparameter, giving consistent results when above 100. I arbitrarily set it to 500 for most of y tests.

Using this, I obtain an accuracy score of around 0.8 to 0.9, showing that I was somewhat consistent in my labeling.

I then process the Ritz-Carlton data using this model, which shows me a proportion of fake accounts of 0.20 - 0.21, which is nowhere near the 0.78 I have found online (see point 5 of original plan, above).

There are multiple possible reasons for that:
* Although my labeling was consistent, it wasn't necessarily accurate: as stated above, I am biased in my decision process, and I may have consistently mislabeled accounts.
* The data on the article wasn't necessarily accurate, although I find that unlikely (data provided by the company Points North Group).
* The data in the article may be outdated, as it dates back to March 2018, and this analysis was done in June 2019.

Finally, even if I'm able to pinpoint fake Instagram followers, that doesn't mean that legitimate Instagram users don't share similar characteristics. For example, a user may have few to no posts, few followers and many followings because they use Instagram quasi-exclusively to check up on influencers, and not to make posts on their own.

We could probably go past this problem if we had more data, such as the user's location, average connection time, ...
